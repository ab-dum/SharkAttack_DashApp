# Shark Attack Dash App
In this project, it is aimed to create a dash app that filters the shark attacks that took place in the world between 2017 and 1917. For this, year and country information is obtained from the user and a bar chart shows the number of attacks and the gender in which the shark attacked in an unprovoked/provoked state.
